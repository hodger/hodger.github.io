### Hi, I'm Ryan.

**Career**: I enjoy working on software projects. 

I started programming at the beginning of high school, and that interest eventually led me to the University of South Carolina, where I got my Bachelor's in Computer Science. I got a lot of experience as a developer during school, both in research positions and internships. Solving problems through code is really satisfying to me, but I also enjoy working as a project manager, which is mainly what I do at Boeing right now. I get to oversee large-scale software/systems projects as they come together and make an impact, and that's a really cool feeling.

**Other**: I'm a writer and a musician. 

Especially comedic writing and especially piano and guitar, respectively. I've also dabled in acting/amateur film while in school, which you can see on a different page of this website.

**Summary**: I think I enjoy the things I do because they allow me to create things that have an affect on people. I like making people laugh. I also like building software that makes people happy.
