### Hi, I'm Ryan.

**Career**  

I started programming at the start of high school, primarily out of curiousity- I always liked video games and working with computers, but realized one day that I knew very little about how they worked. So, after plinking around in Command Prompt for a while, I went to my local Half Price Books and got [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Without-Fear-Beginners-Guide-Makes/dp/0134314301) on C++. I made a few games with the Allegro game library (thanks to [this guy](https://twitter.com/mikegeig?lang=en)'s tutorials), and afterwards moved on to learning Java as well.

Eventually, my hobby led me to the University of South Carolina, where I got my Bachelor's in Computer Science. I was fortunate to get a lot of development experience during school, both in research positions and internships. You can check out my resume or LinkedIn for a more comprehensive list, but to summarize, I left school with a particular love of Python, Git, and learning the best way to solve a problem.

Currently I work as a software engineer at [PayScale](https://payscale.com) in Seattle, where we use crowdsourced salary data to help people get paid fairly.

**Other Stuff**

I do a bit of creative writing and making music (piano and guitar, mostly). I founded a [satirical newspaper at U of SC](http://thirdspur.com) with some friends, which was an amazing experience. I've also done a bit of acting and writing for short films, which you can see on a different page of this website.
