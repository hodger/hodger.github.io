### Hi, I'm Ryan.

**Career:** *I really enojoy building software (most of the time)* 

I started programming at the start of high school, primarily out of curiousity- I always liked video games and working with computers, but realized one day that I knew very little about how they worked. So, after plinking around in Command Prompt for a while, I went to my local Half Price Books and got [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Without-Fear-Beginners-Guide-Makes/dp/0134314301) on C++. I made a few games with the Allegro game library (thanks to [this guy](https://twitter.com/mikegeig?lang=en)'s tutorials), and afterwards moved on to learning Java as well.

Eventually, my hobby led me to the University of South Carolina, where I got my Bachelor's in Computer Science. I was fortunate to get a lot of development experience during school, both in research positions and internships. You can check out my resume or LinkedIn for a more comprehensive list, but if I can summarize, I left school with a particular love of Python, Git, and learning the best way to solve a problem.

Currently I work as a software developer at Boeing in Seattle, hacking on things like microservices frameworks and data streaming platforms.

**Other:** *Writing and Music*

Respectively: especially satirical writing, and especially piano and guitar. I founded a satirical newspaper at U of SC, which was an amazing experience. I've also done a bit of acting/short film, which you can see on a different page of this website.

**Wrapping Up:** *A healthy dose of self-analysis*

I think I enjoy the things I do because they allow me to create concrete things that I can be proud of. Being able to go back to a song or article or program I wrote to see where I've progressed is really satisfying.
