### Lots of people want you to learn to code.

*It's a trend.*

There are about a gazillion online coding schools, YouTube tutorials, and blog posts (sorry) blaring that message over and over and over.

Code is *not* the future, it is the *right now*, they say, and the general advice is that you shouldn't get left behind. No, you should **learn to code**! And I'm not disagreeing that learning to code is a huge benefit.

The main point that I want to make is that like any other field of study, there's something to be said about where a new student ought to begin.
