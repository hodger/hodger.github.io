### Lots of people want you to learn to code.

*It's a trend.*

There are about a gazillion online coding schools, YouTube tutorials, and blog posts (sorry) blaring that message over and over and over.

Code is not the *future*, it is the *right now*, they say, and the general advice is that you should do what you can to not be left behind. You should **learn to code**! And, to be honest, I'm not disagreeing that learning to code is a huge benefit.

The main point that I want to make is that like any other field of study, there's something to be said about where a new student ought to begin. It's important to have a good foundation in what you want to learn before moving onto more specialized or advanced topics. 

And when you think about it, learning to write Javascript/HTML/CSS for websites, like many of the online courses encourage, *is* pretty specific! It's not where I think you should start.

Understanding some Computer Science fundamentals will pay huge dividends when trying to pick up coding, because the programming language you're learning only exists because of those fundamentals. They aren't unrelated, theoretical hocus pocus (well mostly not). These concepts are deeply coupled with the work you'll be doing day-to-day. Taking some time to learn them will make you *a better coder from the get-go*.

### Layers of abstraction
