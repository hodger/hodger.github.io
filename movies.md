<p>"Webster" is a movie we submitted for Campus Movie Fest in 2017. I primarily wrote the script, but also assisted with directing. We were ranked in the top 16 films and I was awarded the Golden Tripod for Best Performance.</p>

<p>"The Coopers" was the first film that my team and I submitted in Campus Movie Fest, back in 2015. It all started with a bad pun. This was a blast to write and landed us in the top 16 films for that year.</p>
